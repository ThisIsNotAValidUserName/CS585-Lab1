# CS585-Lab1
Solution for BU CS585 Lab1 <br>
## Requirements
1. Create a grayscale image of your face by converting your color image using one of the conversions we discussed in class last week. <br>
2. Flip your face image horizontally, i.e. left to right, right to left. <br>
3. Come up with a third way of manipulating your face that produces an interesting output. For example, you may create a blurred image of your grayscale face by assigning to each pixel the average grayscale pixel value of itself and its 8 neighbors. Hint: You may have to run your program a few times to make the blurring noticeable. <br>

The code is written in C++ with OpenCV 3.3.0
